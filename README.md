<h3 align="center">PROFILE</h3>

------  

<p align="center">I am a visual designer with a certiﬁcate for user-centered design, thriving on creating progressive, meaningful and visually pleasing solutions for a wide variety of projects. My passion lies in creating content and concepts for print, web or mobile, logo design and branding, as well as typography. My international background in visual merchandising design as well as my multimedia design education allow me to think outside the box and are paired with an eagerness for tackling new challenges. Project management and the ability to work within a team is an additional area I excel in. I remain calm under tight deadlines while developing and implementing eﬀective and innovative projects from concept to completion.</p>
